### BUS216 HW3: Movie_Recommender_System

#### <ins>Content</ins>: 
This project is using the Dash package in Python to build a movie recommender system website. When the user inputs a movie name or a tag name, the website will show the top six movies that related to the keyword. Moreover, the website is also displaying and recommending movies that are top rated, most reviewed, and belong to several genres in different blocks. 

Note:
- The ratings are calculated using a weighted formula
- Each blocks are showing only six movies randomly
- If user clicks the movie icon, it will lead the user to the movie's website
- The images of the movie icons are scraped from the tmdb movie API
